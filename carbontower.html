					<p>
						Global climate change continues to be an ever-present issue affecting multiple facets of nature.
						The monitoring of gases such as CO₂ and other greenhouse gases has become crucial in
						understanding the driving forces behind climate change. It is generally accepted that
						anthropogenic CO₂ emissions affect the carbon cycle, but other processes also play beneficial or
						detrimental roles. Photosynthesis and respiration by plants can both remove and emit CO₂.
						Monitoring the gas exchange between vegetation and the atmosphere from multiple locations
						globally allows for more reliable climate change forecasts. The Eddy Covariance method, which
						requires sensors to measure atmospheric gas flux, is used for this purpose.
					</p>
					<p>
						Louisiana is the 33rd state to implement a tower to monitor gas exchange and the first in the
						state built for this purpose. Data from this tower will join the national AmeriFlux network—a
						database that aggregates flux data from towers across North and South America for climate model
						interpretation. This research aligns ULM with leading institutions and highlights the state’s
						potential.

					<h3><i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i> Site Description</h3>
					<p>
						ULM's flux tower is located in the heart of the Russell Sage Wildlife Management Area.
						Surrounded by mature bottomland hardwood forest, the tower’s sensors capture accurate readings
						of gas exchange. The clay soil and seasonal flooding further characterize the site.
					</p>
					<p>Below is an aerial view of the site:</p>

					<h3><i class="fas fa-tools"></i> Tower Construction</h3>
					<p>
						In July 2013, a 120‑foot tower was constructed in the Russell Sage Wildlife Management Area by
						<a href="https://plus.google.com/112959845910092569716/about?gl=us&hl=en">Bleu Skies Tower
							Services, LLC</a>.
						The tower was subsequently outfitted with sensors to monitor carbon flux. Multiple sensors
						positioned around the tower enable continuous monitoring of carbon flux, solar radiation,
						temperature, rainfall, and soil moisture. An image below shows the tower with sensor positions.
