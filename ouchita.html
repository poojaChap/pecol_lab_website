                        Bottomland hardwood forest (BLH, Rarity Rank: S4/G4G5) ecosystems in the southeastern US have
                        been called an <strong>“ecosystem in crisis”</strong> (Creasman et al. 1992). The Louisiana
                        State Wildlife Action Plan (Lester et al. 2005) identifies BLH forests as home to <strong>34
                            species of concern</strong>, including birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and butterflies.
                        Over <strong>70% of BLH in Louisiana</strong> has been lost due to land conversion, urbanization,
                        and other land use changes (Haynes et al. 1988).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recognizing the importance of BLH systems, the <strong>Louisiana Department of Wildlife and
                            Fisheries</strong> began conservation efforts in 1961, acquiring over <strong>222,000 acres
                            of BLH</strong>. Additional reforestation through the <strong>Wetlands Reserve Program
                            (WRP)</strong> has restored over <strong>270,000 acres</strong> in the Mississippi Alluvial
                        Valley. However, many of these maturing forests lack structural complexity, which reduces
                        wildlife habitat value. Proper management strategies, such as canopy gap creation, are
                        essential to restoring wildlife habitat diversity.

                    <p>
                        The majority of BLH reforestation sites are even-aged and relatively homogeneous in both species
                        composition and habitat quality. Active forest management can help accelerate succession to
                        resemble mature forests, ensuring critical wildlife habitat. Creating forest canopy gaps
                        promotes a diverse shrub layer, benefiting **Neotropical migrant songbirds** and **species of
                        concern** identified in the Louisiana Wildlife Action Plan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Increased midstory and understory layers provide essential food sources for wildlife species,
                        including the **Louisiana Black Bear**. Additionally, deadwood material benefits amphibians,
                        reptiles, and small mammals by improving habitat complexity and increasing invertebrate
                        availability.
