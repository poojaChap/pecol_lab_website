					<p>
						<h8>Makayla Holman</h8> Makayla is a native of Monroe, Louisiana and is a senior undergraduate
						majoring in Biology with EEB concentration and a minor in English. Makaylaâ€™s curiosity is piqued
						by epiphyte plants and how their subtle interaction with their environment impacts it. Her
						current project involves using vertical profiling temperature data from the US-ULM Carbon Flux
						Tower in a Bottomland Hardwood Forest in RussellSage Wildlife Management Area, to observe how
						temperatures gradients impact tree phenology.
					</p>

					<p>
						<bold>Research Interests:</bold>
					</p>
					Ecosystem Level Ecology

					Land-Use and Land-Cover Mapping
					Biodiversity and Conservation
					Forest Canopy Spectral Dynamics
					Forest Phenology
					Global Change Ecology and Management

					<P> Current Project:
						Melissa is assessing the optical-phenological variability in the bottomland hardwood forest at
						Russell Sage WMA, the site of the Carbon Flux Tower. Using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and
						spectral cameras she has already mapped species distribution based on spectral profiles of
						delineated crowns. She is currently examining the seasonality of various spectral and
						biophysical indices. She is looking for connections between the representation of canopy
						spectral properties, weather conditions and carbon flux.
