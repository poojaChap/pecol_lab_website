				<p><h2>Dr. Charles Allen Nature Preserve</h2></p>
			    <p><h3>Background</h3></p>
					<p>The Dr. Charles Allen Nature Preserve is an 80 acre outdoor classroom located in the rolling Ouachita Hills Region near Columbia, La, about 30 miles from the campus of ULM.
					<p>The property was donated to ULM in the year 2000 by Dr. Harry Winters in honor of Dr. Charles Allen, a former ULM professor and accomplished botonist in Louisiana. Over the years, Dr. Winters and Dr. Allen have co-authored several books on the plants of Louisiana and the Gulf South, but CABS is arguably one of their greatest contributions to the state. Efforts are currently underway to make CABS more accessible to ULM students and faculty and develop a master plan for the property. In the future, we hope to make CABS a premiere site for researchers through the state and region.
				<h3>2016 ULM BioBlitz</h3></p>
					<p><a href="../images/bioblitz_full.png"> <img width="530" height="338" alt="ulm biological station" src="../images/bioblitz.png"></a></p>
					<p>On October 29, 2016 ULM Biology students (Nu-Gamma Chapter of BBB Biology Honor Society) and faculty will lead hikes through the
						rolling Ouachita Hills near Columbia, LA. Led primarily by students the event is
						meant to showcase the Biology Department’s outdoor classroom, the Charles
						Allen Biological Station. During this all-day event, participants can expect
						to hike through high ridges and bottomlands on a mission to spot and identify as
						many life forms as possible: birds, plants, reptiles, amphibians, mammals,
						butterflies and more!</p>
      			<p><h8>GOALS</h8></p>
      			<p>•	Discover, learn about and document the biological diversity of the Charles Allen Biological Station</p>
      			<p>•	Interpret the natural history of the many organisms encountered to broader ULM community  </p>
      			<p>•	Provide an opportunity for non-science and science majors alike to appreciate the natural world and interact with scientists      			  </p>
      			<p>•	To bring together faculty and students in a shared experiential learning environment      			  </p>
